# API-3-shorturl
Free Code Camp third API challenge: create an url shortening microservice.

Free Code Camp describes the objective and requirements of this challenge as follows:

Objective: Build a full stack JavaScript app that is functionally similar to this: https://little-url.herokuapp.com/ and deploy it to Heroku.

	Note that for each project, you should create a new GitHub repository and a new Heroku project.
	If you can't remember how to do this,
	revisit https://freecodecamp.com/challenges/get-set-for-our-api-development-projects.

Here are the specific user stories you should implement for this project:

1. User Story: I can pass a URL as a parameter and I will receive a shortened URL in the JSON response.

2. User Story: If I pass an invalid URL that doesn't follow the valid http://www.example.com format, the JSON response will 		 contain an error instead.

3. User Story: When I visit that shortened URL, it will redirect me to my original link.
